Hello!
This SpringBoot Application will launch an Inventory Management System using API's

The Cash Register will report Data to a S3 bucket, in which the Accounting Service will pull from to create reports about the company

Use 
http://localhost:8080/accounting/ to access the Accounting Service

Other Services such as Payroll and Inventory are updates for the near future
